Hello! Iâ€™m Xiaoshan Lin, a **PhD student** majoring in <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/aem">Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics</a>
at the **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**.

My research interests lie in
- **Motion Planning**: 
  - Developing solutions for energy-constrained heterogeneous multi-robot systems with a focus on environmental monitoring.
- **Reinforcement Learning**:
  - Exploring temporal logic specifications with a focus on achieving probabilistic satisfaction guarantees.

In my spare time, I like cooking, hiking and playing with my cat.
