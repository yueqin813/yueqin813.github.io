ðŸŒŸ **Wrapping Up an Amazing Internship at <a href="https://www.merl.com/">Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) </a>!** ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my internship at **MERL** as a **research intern**. During this internship, my
work focused on

##### Experimental Validation:

- Implemented Python code in the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** to validate a bi-level planning approach for environmental monitoring using:
  - **UAVs**: 4 **Crazyflie** drones.
  - **Mobile Charging Stations**: 2 **Turtlebot**.

##### Code Development:

- Developed codes for **UAVs** to autonomously land on **wireless chargers**.
- Implemented **UAV-UGV coordination** and **collision avoidance** algorithms.
- Created control algorithms for the **UGVs** (Turtlebots).

A big thank to **Dr. Abraham Vinod** and the incredible team for their mentorship and support. Iâ€™m thrilled to share 
that my work during this internship will result in a paper that we plan to submit to a journal. Stay tuned for more updates!

Looking forward to applying what I've learned as I continue my PhD research!
